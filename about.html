<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p> I'm "Tattoo" Tim Hickey, a retro games enthusiast and independent game developer. 
Starting with python, and later moving on to Unity and C# scripting, I endeavored to 
finally create my own video game, a dream of mine since I was 6. I succeeded, releasing
my first game (<a href = "malbono_manor.html">Malbono Manor</a>) on the iOS platform. 
if you find any bugs or glitches (and you will!) or you just like the design of the
site, or you would like to talk about kettlebells, feel free to <a href ="timothy.john.hickey@gmail.com">email me.</a> 

As far as my other interests, I enjoy physical fitness and try to find time to exercise 
daily. I just recently started a bodyweight routine after reading <i>Convict Conditioning</i>. 
I remember reading a really famous trainer once say that the smarter his old training buddies got, the 
less workout equipment they needed and owned. I believe the subject of that particular writing owned 
one bar and two 45 lb. plates. For me, "my can't live without" piece of equipment is my 30 lb. 
kettlebell. 

<p>  Anyway, I decided that there should be an easy way to play my games, and itch.io hosting and
the HTML5 standard seem like a good way to reach a very large audience. And hey, if they're
gonna be on the internet, might as well curate them a little. I find the game making process
fascinating, and I hope that you get at least some kind of entertainment out of this site.

<p><h2>ON MAKING GAMES </h2>

<p> As you can tell, I like a certain period in gaming a lot - it's also conducive to 
quickly doing lots of small projects, as it's easy to create sprites and backgrounds, and 
the limited palettes make color decisions a lot simpler compared to more complicated
pixel art. 

<p>I've been interested in coding for a long time. In a recent discussion with my Ludum 
Dare team mate, I traced my interest in coding back to the Game-Genie, by Galoob toys. 
I didn't quite understand what was going on at the time, but I do remember my first 
self-received bit of coding knowledge: FF means 'a lot' or 'Maximum' (or, more accurately,
255). Gold, life, remaining time, you name it. They said you could make your own codes, 
but why not just crank that baby up to FF and see what happens? 

<p>After playing a Castlevania fan game in high school I bought a couple books on C++ and 
game development and...failed to compile even a single program. I remember failing to compile 
Hello world. I wish I could go back and see just what I'd done wrong, because it was undoubtedly 
minor and easily remedied, but ah, youth. Those books gathered dust and I never seriously 
considered coding again for a decade or so. 

<p>In 2015, I made a New Years resolution to make my own game. I didn't really start taking 
it seriously until the end of the year, but I did manage to succeed in making something 
that was technically a game. It was a direct copy of a Python tutorial, but it satisfied 
my own requirements - at the barest level. I decided that for 2016, I was gonna set out to 
start and finish a retro game project. 

<p><h2>ON LEARNING TO CODE</h2>

<p>As I mentioned, I started learning to code in Python. I found the syntax easy to pick 
up. I developed a good portion of a game in Python, in that a lot of the graphics and 
major mechanics were in place, though there were big challenges ahead. And this was <i>after </i>
I finally got collision to work. Writing collision detection in Python is not what I'd call 
a fun experience. The Pygame library had apparently been mostly abandoned, left to collect 
dust as little more than a curiosity. This meant known issues were just...known. It was 
frustrating. 

<p>After trying to figure out how to do something crazy - I had created all the 8-bit sprites
authentically and the game resolution was too small and EVERYTHING had to be scaled with code - I stumbled upon a 
reddit thread where a user bluntly told the python using question seeker to abandon his python 
project and just use unity. It was a tough decision. I estimate my original game had about 30%
of the functionality needed to be finished. A lot of it worked! But in the end I decided
to pull the plug and learn JavaScript. Unity can run those scripts, and for some reason 
that is now lost to me in the fog of exhaustion and web-based tutorials, I thought the transition
from Python would be easier. I completed CodeAcademy's JavaScript tutorial and dived into Unity. 

<p>Unity is an amazing tool - when one redditor said it 'felt like cheating' I totally understood
where he was coming from. It's definitely the tool set I'll be using until they release a version
that sucks. Hopefully that's not anytime soon. 

<p>After a few days of working with JavaScript, I began to find that most other devs preferred
C#, and a lot of questions were asked regarding C# code and (naturally) answered with C# answers.
It quickly became evident I had to switch. Speaking the same language as the main unity crowd was 
going to be important in order to really understand the problems and solutions proposed. but 
learning C# was a daunting task. Isn't that a *gasp* <i>real</i> programming
language? 

<p>My previous experience gave me the foundation I needed to understand C# quickly, and what had 
taken me painstaking months to create in python was largely recreated in Unity in a few <i>days</i>. 

<p>Around this time, I also started to feel less confident in the theme and my ability to properly 
execute the game mechanics I wanted to include. It was around this time that I played Ys, and seeing how
the vastly simplified combat system would be a much better fit on a mobile platform, I decided to totally 
scrap my original concept. At this point I'd abandoned two programming languages and an entire concept! 

<p>My work on Malbono Manor was tireless. Even still, I found out how quickly even simple things (or 
things I thought were simple) could eat up huge chunks of time. I'd been interested in Digital art for a 
long time, and tended to fall back on that when doing something with code seemed daunting. 

<p>After months of what seemed like an infinite amount of work, where the end state was always one bit
of polish away, I got to a state where you could play the whole game through (albeit not without bugs) and 
put my game on the Apple Store. I couldn't believe it. You can search for my game and find it. 

<p>That more or less gets us up to speed. Check out my blog posts for current updates!
