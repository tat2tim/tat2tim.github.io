<h1>MALBONO MANOR</h1>

<h1>RELEASE DATE: OCTOBER 2016</h1>

<h1><a href ="tat2tim.github.io/malbono_manor_web_build/index.html">PLAY IT!</a></h1>


<p>My first game! Originally released on iOS. My first effort at making a game 
was actually a retro-style Metal Gear parody called 'Sneak Shot'. After playing 
one of the <a href = "https://archive.org/details/segasms_Ys_-_Ancient_Ys_Vanished_Omen_Rev_1_1988_Falcom_-_Sega">
Ys</a> games on the Virtual Console I decided to start from scratch, using a 
similar battle system, because I thought it would work better on the mobile platform. 
Honestly, I never felt the touch controls were great, and I think the game is much 
better like this, as it's more true to the retro experience than playing it on a phone. 
(although having an app on the app store is neat).  


<p> I've always been a fan of horror themed games from the early 8-bit era, and the 
haunted house theme (and vastly simplified gameplay) were a much better fit for my 
creative process and programming skill level at the time. I'm a bit ashamed to say that 
after years of criticizing larger devs for rushing products to market...I rushed my product
to market. I was just super excited about having a real game released on a real platform, 
and I could download it to my own phone!

<p><h1>TRIVIA</h1>

<p>This game has an OST that will never see the light of day. It is awful. 
I had someone much better write the music. His webpage is here. 

<p>In the original version of the game, there was going to be two different versions of 
the medicine item (one was a full heal)

<p>The Mallet was originally a fire axe, intended to serve as an item to smash the walls
and a weapon upgrade.
